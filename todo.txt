Plans for 11-12-2024

1. I want to thik on how to make file input work and build a tree

1.1 To do that I need to pass the file directly to sequence alignment function in case of FASTA input
1.2 In case of Excel file format inpput I need to pass the data directly to dissimilarity_matrix() function,
 as it assumes user's manual alignment
------------

2. After that I need th think about how to make calculations perform in a separate thread.

2.1 To do that I need to build the file accepting part first
