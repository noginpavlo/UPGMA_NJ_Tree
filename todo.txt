1. I want to thik on how to make file input work and build a tree

1.1 To do that I need to pass the file directly to sequence alignment function
 in case of FASTA input
1.2 In case of Excel file format inpput I need to pass the data directly to dissimilarity_matrix() function
 as it assumes user's manual alignment
------------

2. After that I need to think about how to make calculations perform in a separate thread.

2.1 To do that I need to build the file accepting part first

I basically did nothin of the above. Good luck tomorow!

3.1 I have realized that I actually need to send a responce to Flask backend that contains file.
 It is challenging to do because of that <a> tag which serves as a button. I need to figure out how to pass
the file using JavaScript other than regular request responce via POST.

4.1 I made it accept the file and send it to backend. The problem is that now sequence input doesn't work as intended
 It  doesn't redirect to dedicated page, it rather askes for file input as if it still FASTA or Excel input. So JS code
doesn't change the button functionality in accordance with data input option. FIX THAT.

4.2 If 4.1 fixed, then handle the file input tree building functionality. Make it work and call it a day.
