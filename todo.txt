Plans for 11-12-2024

1. I want to thik on how to make file input work and build a tree

1.1 To do that I need to pass the file directly to sequence alignment function
 in case of FASTA input
1.2 In case of Excel file format inpput I need to pass the data directly to dissimilarity_matrix() function
 as it assumes user's manual alignment
------------

2. After that I need th think about how to make calculations perform in a separate thread.

2.1 To do that I need to build the file accepting part first

I basically did nothin of the above. Good luck tommarow!

3.1 I have realized that I actually need to send a responce to Flask backend that contains file.
 It is challenging to do because of that <a> tag which serves as a button. I need to figure out how to pass
the file using JavaScript other than regular request responce via POST.
